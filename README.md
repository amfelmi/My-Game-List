To run the code, make sure to run the Recommender.py file and Search.py files from the Python Recommender folder. 

Then run the userServer.js by typing “node userServer.js” in the terminal while in the Nodejs Backend directory. 

Finally, run the React code by typing “npm start” in the terminal while in the my-react-app directory.  

If the input field in the recommender page does not work (due to CORS), try restarting the Search.py server. 

Finally, python dependencies are in the "Dependencies.txt" file. For Express and React, there are package in their 
respective folers.
